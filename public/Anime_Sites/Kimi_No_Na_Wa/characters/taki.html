        <p>
          About: <br />
          Taki is the male protagonist in Kimi No Na Wa. He juggles his part-time job at an Italian Job with his school life, where he aspires to becomes an architect. His ordinary lifestyle suddenly had a massive change when he woke up and had swapped bodies with the female protagonist , <a href="mitsuha.html">Mitsuha Miyamuzu</a> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Personality : <br />
          Taki is a kind, hardworking and caring individual. He is a very helpful and responsible person. He is organized and mostly handles everything quite nicely such as his busy lifestyle. <br />
          Since he's aspiring to be an architect he also has a creative side, also having good artistic abilities. <br />
          Taki is considered stubborn as he can be persistent. He may even be called sensitive and impatient as he gets angered quickly.  <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          As previously mentioned , Taki is somewhat quick-tempered.Seen in the beginning of the movie, he gets into fights easily. He is also blunt and he tends to blurt out the first thing on his mind without restraint. However, he quickly fixes his way of speaking by saying what he really wants the second after. Since Taki hates belittlement from others, he is very straightforward and can stand up for himself and others. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Taki is also horrible at romance. Just like most of us! <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Taki is a very determined person, as he explores the rural parts of Japan in order to meet Mitsuha in person, with only minimal knowledge of where she is or where to even begin finding her. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          As an adult: <br />
          Taki has matured but still has his former personality. He has developed an even deeper fascination with architecture and Itomori, the place that disappeared.There is a little more to him as an adult but I would be spoiling a lot more, so watch the movie to find out!

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Fun Facts!</h2>
        <p>
          In "Weathering In You" <br />
          Taki visited his grandmother's house to help her hold the Obon ceremony for his late grandfather. He met Hina Amano and Hodaka Morishima there and advised Hodaka to find a gift for Hina's upcoming birthday. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Taki has a tendency to clench his fist when embarrassed or nervous. <br />
          &nbsp; <br />
          Taki's name (瀧), combines the characters for "water" and "dragon". <br />
          It shows a connection between himself and Mitsuha. Water (Mizu) is mentioned in Mitsuha's surname and since the Miyamizu folklore includes mention of a dragon.
